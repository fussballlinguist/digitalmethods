This project comes up with some Perl scripts for tasks similar to those of the [Digital Methods Initiative](https://wiki.digitalmethods.net/Dmi/WinterSchool2019).

# Scripts

**screencast_documentary.pl** is a script to scrape the URLs of all versions of Wikipedia pages (including user pages etc.) to make automatized screenshots of a defined number of URLs (say the first 50 versions or the 50 most recent ones) and to generate a video from the pictures. Thus, the script generates screencast documentaries as outlined by Richard Rogers in his article [Doing Web history with the Internet Archive: screencast documentaries](https://doi.org/10.1080/24701475.2017.1307542).
